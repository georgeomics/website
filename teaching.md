### University of Central Florida
#### BSC4445C: Genomics Laboratory (4 Credits)
*Semesters Taught: Fall 2024*  
[Syllabus](assets/documents/BSC4445C_RI_Syllabus_FA2024.pdf)  
An upper level undergraduate course focused on the generation and analysis of genomic data. I developed a novel research project specifically for the course, which served as the focus for all molecular and bioinfomatic work. Students were guided through a variety of laboratory methods in genomics including DNA extraction, PCR, and Illumina library preparation, followed by bioinformatic analysis using command line tools and software such as QIIME2 and Geneious. As a university designmated research intensive (RI) course, students completed a comprehensive project while generating and analyzing genetic datasets, culminating in oral and written reports.

#### PCB3063L: Genetics Laboratory (1 Credit)
*Semesters Taught: Spring 2024, Spring 2023, Fall 2022, Fall 2021*  
[Syllabus](assets/documents/PCB3063L_Syllabus_SP2024.pdf)  
Laboratory course focused on introducing undergraduates to concepts and methods in molecular and genetic laboratory work. Included multi-week projects to allow students to build upon key genetic concepts in a hands-on manner followed by a written report.
