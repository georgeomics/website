    I am using data from genetic markers to determine how Mountain Lion (Puma concolor) population structure, migration, and genetic variation have been affected by anthropogenic development, particularly in the southwestern US.

    I am generating whole genome sequencing data to compare adaptations in Florida Key Deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) to other species in highly urbanized environments.

    I am collaborating with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to generate whole genome sequencing data for Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Our focus is on understanding their interactions with the environment and how this might relate to their adaptability under changing climatic conditions.
