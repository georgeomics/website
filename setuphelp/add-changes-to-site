--------------------------------------------------------------------
KEEP CHISELING ON YOUR BLOG!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now all that you have to do is keep making edits to your blog.

Each time you make some changes to blog files on your computer, do the following:
Type ‘jekyll serve’ to preview your changes

ADDING CHANGES TO SITE:
First, make sure you are in the folder directory (e.g. </Users/georgezaragoza/Documents/Scripts/Xcode/personalsite/personalsite>)
    -Update: </Users/georgezaragoza/OneDrive/Scripts/Xcode/website/royce-jekyll-theme-v1.2.0/Royce>

If you’re happy with the changes and want to publish, first collect all the files to publish by typing ‘git add .’
ALTERNATIVELY: You can use git add * to add all files in a directory

Now make the commit by typing ‘git commit -m commit message’

Finally, type ‘git push origin gh-pages’

That’s it!
Time to get cracking at your new blog. All the best :)
