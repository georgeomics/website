From: https://support.google.com/drive/thread/12769849?hl=en

* "Basically, a way is same as what the page that you refereed is describing, but the difference is the address of the URL. "docs.google.com" is only for google docs, and "drive.google.com" is for any other file other than docs.

* So, basical format is > https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YourFile'sID

* Also, there is a creating service site > https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/"
