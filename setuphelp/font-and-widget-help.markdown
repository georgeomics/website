#  Font & Widget Help

## Font
* If you want to add a new font (from Google Fonts), add it in the 'includes_/head.html' file

* To request the font to be used somewhere on the site (like in the heading), specify in '_sass/0-settings/_variables.scss'

## Widget
* To add a new widget, you may first need to specify in '_config.yml'.

* To see changes, you may also need to add them in the '_includes/sidebar-widgets/widget-author.html'
