Hi, I'm George. I'm a PhD student at the University of Central Florida studying wildlife conservation, ecology, and genomics. I'm broadly interested in how human-wildlife relationships have shaped the evolution of interspecies communities, and what that implies for the adaptability and resilience of these communities in the future. Currently, my projects include research on white-tailed deer, Florida panthers, and Florida key deer.
