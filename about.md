Hi, I'm George, a PhD Student at the University of Central Florida studying wildlife conservation and genomics. I am interested in learning about the past, present, and future of the relationship humans had, have, and will have with the natural world. In particular, I study how environmental change (particularly climate-driven or anthropogenic) has impacted other species and develop predictions to identify populations at risk of disappearing in the future.

What is "Georgeomics"? The suffix 'Omics has an obscure history. Frequently used to describe contemporary molecular biology fields (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.), the use of 'Omics seeks to contextualize these fields as holistic approaches aiming to leverage modern technological advances to create a comprehensive story of the evolution of life on Earth. 'Omics thus overlaps conceptually with the Hindu symbol "Om", both eliciting a sense of universality. "Georgeomics" is simply my story.
